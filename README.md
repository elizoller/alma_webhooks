# Using Node to Listen to Alma Webhooks
For Code4Lib 2019 Workshop by Eli Zoller

## Get Started - To Do before the workshop starts
1. Check your node version
`node -v`
If the output is greater than 8, you'll be good for this project.
If you don't have node installed, go to https://nodejs.org/en/ to download it.
If you require a specific version of node running in your environment for another project, I highly recommend installing a node version manager, such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
2. Check you have npm installed
`npm -v`
If you don't have npm installed, install it `npm install -g npm`
3. It'll be best if you have access to an Alma sandbox, but you can still participate if you don't. Preferrably with the role General System Administrator (this will allow you to create an integration profile).
